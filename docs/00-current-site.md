Aura Recruit website overview
General structure and design

Navigation and layout:

Every page uses a simple top navigation bar with the Aura Recruit logo on the left, followed by links to CV Drop, Meet The Team and Contact Us. Contact details (phone number and info@aurarecruit.com
 email) are displayed on the right of the navigation bar
aurarecruit.com
.

The navigation is fixed; as the user scrolls the content, the bar stays at the top. Links change color on hover and the current page is highlighted (e.g., CV Drop when on the CV drop page
aurarecruit.com
).

Each page begins with a hero section – a full‑width photographic banner featuring European or U.S. cityscapes. Overlayed on the hero image is a large page title in white text (e.g., “PLACING IT PROFESSIONALS AT THE PEAK OF THEIR CAREER” on the home page
aurarecruit.com
) with the light‑grey Aura logo in the center as a watermark.

Colour palette & fonts:

The dominant colors are dark navy/royal blue (#0A1E49 approximate), white and light grey. Dark sections alternate with white sections to create contrast (e.g., dark blue backgrounds behind forms and testimonials, white backgrounds for main copy). The Aura "A" logo is used as a watermark in many sections.

Text appears in a clean sans‑serif font with varying weights for headings and body copy. Headings use uppercase or capitalized letters (e.g., “WHAT AREAS DO WE RECRUIT FOR?”
aurarecruit.com
).

Imagery:

The hero banners depict recognizable European and American cityscapes (Nyhavn in Copenhagen on the home page, a harbour in Oslo on the CV Drop page, Stockholm in the team page and modern buildings for the contact page). These images set a professional tone and connect to the geographic scope of Aura Recruit’s operations.

Icons illustrate recruitment areas (keyboard for software development, cloud for cloud architecture, etc.) and social media links.

Footer:

Each page ends with a dark section containing a testimonial slider followed by a structured footer. The slider displays quotes from clients and candidates praising Aura Recruit’s recruiters (e.g., a Full Stack Developer describing how Matt’s promises “turned out to be true or if not better”
aurarecruit.com
 and a Cellpoint Digital executive praising Connor’s integrity
aurarecruit.com
). Arrows allow switching between quotes, and small dots indicate the number of testimonials.

Below the slider, the footer lists opening hours (Monday‑Friday 9 am‑5 pm; weekend closed)
aurarecruit.com
, address (Aura Recruit Ltd, Office 2 Broomfield Place, 189 Main Road, Chelmsford, Essex CM1 7DJ
aurarecruit.com
), and social links (LinkedIn and Instagram icons
aurarecruit.com
). The copyright notice indicates “© 2026 AURA RECRUIT” and credits Webwax for web design
